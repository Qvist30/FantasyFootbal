fantasy.py is a Python program which reads a bunch of input files with fantasy football rankings in them (Currently from the 2015 season (rankings date: 7/24), using both FFToolbox and ESPN rankings, specific to my league).  It then aggregates the information to come up with a "better" rankings list.

The rankings.xls file that gets placed in the output files directory is the most important file, as this combines all of the rankings in one place.  It gives you each sites total number of points projected for the season, combines these points into points per game, gives you the Bye Week and also compares the players to others at their position.  For instance the "Points over Bench" column displays the number of points that a player is worth per game, vs. the 13th (or 31st) ranked player, depending upon position (QB, TE, K, DEF by default have 12 starters, RB/WR have 30).  Likewise the Points over Waiver is similar, but assumes that twice as many of that position will be drafted, thus compares against either the 25th ranked player, or 61st ranked player.
